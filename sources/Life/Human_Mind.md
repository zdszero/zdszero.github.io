### Hedonic Treadmill

The Hedonic Treadmill, also known as the Hedonic Adaptation, is a psychological phenomenon that refers to the tendency of humans to __return to a relatively stable level of happiness__ or __baseline emotional state__ after experiencing positive or negative life events. It suggests that major life changes or windfalls do not permanently impact happiness.

### Bounded Rationality

When people make decisions, they're limited by __human cognitive abilities__. Poeple often __simplify complex system__ and use __heuristics__ due to __cogntive constraints__ such as time, information and cognitive capacity.

One key concept: __satisficing__, a a portmanteau of “satisfy” and “suffice.” Satisficing means that individuals often seek solutions or make choices that are __good enough__ or __satisfactory__, rather than trying to find the __optimal__ or perfect solution. This helps save time and mental effort.

I think it has some evolutionary wisdom:

- We don't live in a small world.
- Enough information is not possible, and the optimal could hardly be achieved.
- Biases are not errors but heuristics that work in most cases to make us avoid screw-ups.

### Occam Razor

A problem-solving and scientific principle that suggests choosing the simplest explanation or solution that adequately explains the phenomenon or problem at hand.

When faced with complex system, the simple solutions which requires less information are sometimes better.

### Dunning-Kruger Effect

The tendency of individuals with low ability or knowledge in a particular domain to overestimate their competence and believe they are more skilled or knowledgeable than they truly are. Conversely, those with higher competence may underestimate their abilities.

人在不了解的领域往往会大放厥词，过分自信，高估自己的能力。掌握的知识更多，反而更加谦虚。

### Lindy Effect

The Lindy Effect is a concept suggesting that the longer a non-perishable idea, technology, or cultural artifact survives, the longer its expected remaining lifespan. In other words, the longer something has been around, the longer it is likely to continue to exist.

### IDEA Effect

The IKEA effect is a cognitive bias that describes consumers’ tendency to __value something more__ if they have made it themselves. That is why brands often use the IKEA effect to have customizations for final products, as they help the consumer relate to it more and therefore appending to it more value.

### Jealous

嫉妒具有某种进化论上的意义。

妒忌会驱使我们去战斗。当其他生物抢占着食物时，远古时代的猎人和狩猎者如果不去妒忌，那他们便会被群体所排斥，在极端的情况还会被活活饿死。

嫉妒还有一个很有意思的现象：你会嫉妒周围的人，那些年龄、职业、生活方式和你类似的人，而不是那些不在你生活

我们在原始社会只能以群居的方式生存下来。因此在人类进化的过程中，我们 __对其他人如何思考、如何感觉已经形成了精细的感受__ （潜意识中可以捕捉他人的行为，女性尤甚），科学上称之为“心智理论”。

人类不喜欢冰冷的数据和理性的现实，人类倾向于故事。

### Procrastination

拖延也具有某种进化论上的意义。

人类会颂扬那种 “敢想敢做、知行合一、不拖延” 的人的行为，但是我们没有意识到的是，这种基因大多数都被自然界淘汰掉了，只有少数被遗留下来，这种偏好其实也许是某种幸存者偏差。
