% Economy Bubble

### The Bubble Triangle

- Speculation
- Marketability
    - legality
    - divisibility
    - the ease of finding the buyer and seller
- Money/Credit

Marketability is the oxygen for the boom. Money and credit are the fuel for the
boom. And speculation is the heat for the boom. Just as a fire produces its own
heat once it starts, speculative investment is self-perpetuating.

During bubbles, large numbers of novices become speculators, many of whom trade
purely on momentum, buying when prices are rising and selling when prices are
falling.

<b><u>What is the spark?</u></b>

The spark could be technological innovation or government policy.
