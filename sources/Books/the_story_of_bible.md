% THE STORY OF BIBLE

__Jesus__

He is the god and man at the same time.
He is the god of mercy, the god of suffering.

It gives a meaning to our suffering because there is no human life that lacks some sort of anguish at some point in time.

Suffering in some sense is a necessary part of human condition.
Just as Dostoevsky said, suffering is the origin of all consciousness.
