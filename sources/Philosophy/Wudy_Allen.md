>
> They're not stupid, selfish, greedy, cowardly, short-sighted worms.

这些都是伟大的思想，但是它们都有一个之名的缺陷，就是它们都建立在人性本善这个谬论上。给他们一个机会做好事，它们就会珍惜。以为他们不是愚蠢、自私、贪婪、胆小和目光短浅的蠕虫。

>
> All cowardice comes from not loving, or not loving well, which is the same thing. And when the man who is brave and true looks Death squarely in the face.
>
> It is because they love with sufficient passion, to push death out of their minds, until it returns, as it does, to all men. And then you must make really good love again.

我相信真爱可以，使人忘却死亡。胆小怯弱的人或是不去爱或是不会爱，其实都是一样的。

而如果一位勇敢之士，敢于直面死神的面庞，那是因为他们充满激情的爱，驱散了脑中对死亡的恐惧，当然这份恐惧终会回归，只有真正美妙的性爱能让你再次忘却它。

------

>
> You can't, 'cause, like, you look around, every...every street, every boulevard is its own special art form.
>
> And when you think that in the cold, violent, meaningless universe, that Paris exists, these lights...
>
> I mean, come on, there's nothing happening on Jupiter or Neptune, but from way out in space you can see these lights, the cafe, people drinking, and singing...
>
> I mean, for all we know, Paris is the hottest spot in the universe.

有时候我想，有谁能创作出能和这伟大的城市相媲美的书  油画  交响乐或者雕塑，不可能  因为你看看四周  每一条街，每一条大道都是其独有的艺术形态，而当你想到在这个阴冷、暴力、毫无意义的宇宙之中有巴黎的存在，有这些灯光，木星和海王星上就什么都没有，但从太空深处，你能看见这些灯光、咖啡馆 、歌舞升平的人们，就我所知，巴黎是宇宙中最性感的地方。

>
> And the name for this fallacy is called "golden-age thinking".

> The erroneous notion that a different time period is better than the one one's living in.
>
> It's a flaw in the Romantic imagination of those people who...who find it difficult to cope with the present.

怀旧是否认，否认痛苦的现在。吉尔是个绝对的浪漫主义者，我是说他要是活在完全无限期的否认中，会更幸福，这种谬论叫做黄金时代理论，认为别的时代比自己现在生活的时代更好，这是那些无法应对当前生活的人，所产生的浪漫主义的缺陷。

莱昂纳德说，这就是生活的辛酸，而且我们不仅要忍受这种无意义，更要因为无意义而向生命喝彩。这对我有点儿高深，不过妈妈经常总结说：把每一天当作你的最后一天过，总有一天，你会一切顺利的。

生活是一场喜剧，是虐待狂喜剧作家写的。
