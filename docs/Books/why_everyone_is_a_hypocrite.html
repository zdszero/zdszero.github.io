                <p><strong>Human mind is consistently
                inconsistent</strong></p>
                <p>The mind consist of many different parts. These parts
                often “believe” different, mutually inconsistent
                things.</p>
                <p><strong>You are not your brain</strong></p>
                <p>If you like the metaphor of your mind as a
                government, then “you”—the part of your brain that
                experiences the world and feels like you’re in
                “control”—is better thought of as a press secretary than
                as the president.</p>
                <p><strong>Social Animals</strong></p>
                <p>Human success is deeply tied to our ability to
                navigate the social world. Indeed, in the ongoing debate
                about why human brains are so big—and relative to body
                size they’re really large—a major contender for what
                drove this process is competition in social domains.</p>
                <p>Our survival and reproduction are determined in large
                part by how well we navigate the social world.</p>
                <p>Given this, it’s reasonable to expect that our minds
                are designed to compete fiercely and subtly for the
                benefits in the social world. The outcomes of these
                competitions would have had massive effects on
                reproductive success over the course of human
                evolution.</p>
                <p><strong>Cognitive biases and heuristics</strong></p>
                <p>Human cognition is characterized by various biases
                and heuristics that influence decision-making and
                information processing. These biases may predispose
                individuals to ignore or discount certain information,
                particularly when it conflicts with preexisting beliefs
                or preferences. Modules designed for ignorance may
                exploit these cognitive biases to maintain psychological
                comfort or reduce cognitive dissonance.</p>
                <p><strong>Self-fulfilling prophecies</strong></p>
                <p>Believing in certain outcomes can lead individuals to
                act in ways that make those outcomes more likely to
                occur, thereby validating their initial beliefs. This
                phenomenon applies not only to social interactions, such
                as romantic relationships, but also to broader societal
                dynamics, such as economic crises caused by rumors and
                panic.</p>
