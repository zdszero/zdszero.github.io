                emphasizes that no business is permanent, so it’s
                crucial to prioritize personal wealth over keeping the
                business afloat. He regrets not taking enough money from
                his earlier business (T2) and advises others to avoid
                making the same mistake.</li>
                <li><b>Prioritize Personal Wealth</b>: The primary goal
                of running a business should be to make oneself rich,
                not to sustain the business for vanity or longevity.
                Tate insists on taking money for oneself first, before
                reinvesting too much into the business.</li>
                <li><b>Be Ruthless in Self-Interest</b>: Tate highlights
                the importance of being ruthless in prioritizing
                personal wealth, even if it means letting the business
                fail. He cites examples of business leaders who took
                large sums of money before their companies
                collapsed.</li>
                <li><b>Reputation Management</b>: Take all the crticism
