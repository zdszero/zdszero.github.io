                <p>People have this desire to keep drawing stayed off
                the environment, so they keep chasing high status
                people. But people are just people.</p>
                <p>If you are trying to live up to the superficial
                standards of society. That actually does more harm than
                good even if you reach the standards. Because now you
                are in the mode of reaction.</p>
                <p>Most people obsess about the future, so they’re not
                thinking about the future through their own intentions.
                They are complusively thinking about it. Because they
                are displeased with the moment that’s directly in front
                of them. This is not acting through your own intentions,
                that’s acting to escape mentally.</p>
                <h3 id="now">Now</h3>
                <p>If you in the habit on a day-to-day basis of trying
                to draw state from your environment. If that’s how you
                live your life, is it gonna be natural to walk right up
                to a girl and try to draw state from wihtin at that
                point?</p>
                <p>Core understanding: when you’re speaking with the
                women, what you need to say is jumbled.</p>
                <p>You run out of things when you want something. Trust
                in yourself. Flow. Turn off the noice.</p>
                <p>Thinking (Logic) in almost all endeavors is your
                greastest asset, but in meeting women thinking is your
                greatest weakness.</p>
                <p>Staying with the tension, non-resistance. Edge of
                cockiness.</p>
                <p>Masculinity is the Innate ability every man is born
                with to create attraction with women. You can get in
                touch with that.</p>
                <p>rip the Opaque wall: judgements, comparisons, labels,
                interpretations Your entire congntive model of these is
                a shelter between you and facing reality for what it
                is.</p>
                <p>core fenimine nature: sound, vibe, energy</p>
                <p>Living in the moment:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>melting into the moment rather than struggling
                against it</li>
                <li>have full trust in your faculties to carry you
                forward as issuses come up</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are always forces in this world that is tugging
                at your awareness isn’t it. Force like frustration and
                fear, essentially, they are diseases to creep into you.
                And once you let them in they take over and loop your
                mind endlessly around thoughts that are useless and
                draining.</p>
                <p>walk through the world with ease: put all these
                concepts (core confidence, strong reality, acting
                through your own intention, masculine polarity) into one
                expression</p>
                <p>You are moving with the current of the world not
                against it. You don’t have to be above the world or
                below the world. You don’t have to be better or worse.
                You can be equally at ease amoung affluence as among
                poverty. You don’t attach your identity to any of that.
                In the same way you know that ground is stable and
                you’re breathing. You can navigate the complexities of
                the world with the same certainty as you would just the
                most basic of facts.</p>
                <p>STRONG BELIEF SYSTEM vs FLEXIBLE BELIEF SYSTEM</p>
                <p>the ablity to quickly sift through ideas and either
                take or reject them is actually a strength and skill</p>
                <p>even beyound taht, the more adaptable you are in
                allowing conflicting or paradoxical realities to exist
                in your mind without being shut down by them, the more
                readily you can jump between maps and where other people
                would fall flat on their face, you will stand.</p>
                <p>the map is not the territory</p>
                <p>see the best of yourself, see the best of other
                people.</p>
                <h3 id="social-conditioning">Social Conditioning</h3>
                <p>We learn fast because we are social learners. We live
                in a socially created reality.</p>
                <p>Ideas, no matter how stupid, can spread like wild
                fire.</p>
                <p>That’s human beings, very superstitous creatures.</p>
                <p>When you have certain beliefs, and you’ve being
                building on those beliefs years and years, and finding
                new evidence to reinforce those beliefs years and
                years.</p>
                <p>The way your mind is set up is to continually look
                for evidence to support that belief.</p>
                <p>Society has something that is appreciated,
                simultaneosly your interaction with society is also
                holding you back if you don’t understand it.</p>
                <p>Isn ’t it interesting how society has got us so
                fucking scattered and so fucking stuck on the surface of
                things that we can no longer see the depth of
                things.</p>
                <p>People like that simplicity. They don’t want to look
                at the multi-dimensions of the way the world works. They
                don’t want to dig in deep. They don’t want to be
                requried to be aware all the time. They just want to get
                their believes and then go to sleep and let that belief
                take care of everything.</p>
                <p>Living to other people’s standards can give you a
                temporary fix of confidence, but it wlll not give you a
                real sense of value or self-esteem.</p>
                <p>Society gives you</p>
                <ul>
                <li>a set of achievable goals</li>
                <li>never ending mind stimulation.</li>
                <li>a magic pill for everything.</li>
                <li>an answer for all your problems. The supply will
                always meet the demand.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You will be in the spoke of the wheel if you believe
                in the system, everything will be fine.</p>
                <p>Best comsumers: desatisfied, wild paranoia about
                status, a wild sort of general buzz of confusion about
                who he is, no identity, no values.</p>
                <p>We live in a society where the idea that bad emotions
                are a valid excuse not to act is actually feasible to
                most people.</p>
                <p>Many society before us really value the idea of right
                action. Right action is like muscle. This is what is
                required to be done and I’m gonna do it regardless of my
                emotions. You feel emotions in your body and you move
                forward anyway.</p>
                <p><strong>Chode Characteristics</strong></p>
                <p>Chode don’t know:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>who they are</li>
                <li>what they value</li>
                <li>what they appreciative for so they’re
                disatisfied</li>
                <li>how their emotions work</li>
                <li>their vision out of life</li>
                <li>why certain influences are corruptive and which are
                positive</li>
                </ul>
                <p>That’s what living in reaction. Their mind is blowing
                around like reads in the wind. They are just scattered
                and not centered. It’s well suited for peon but not for
                you.</p>
                <h3 id="nlp">NLP</h3>
                <p>English as a language in many ways dictates our
                concept of reality.</p>
                <p>People use different language to self-hyponotize
                themselves into all sorts of wacky beliefs, and lots of
                emotional pain.</p>
                <p>Is love a feeling of attraction, a feeling of
                connection, a feeling of lust, feeling of physical
                attachment, maybe underlying oneness.</p>
                <p>Love is not caused by another person, it’s a
                self-hyponosis. it’s a trance you put yourself into. and
                as we loop our thoughts over and over around an concept
                of a paticular person. our mind shifts the way that we
                perceive them and suddenly everything make sense: it’s
                love.</p>
                <p>You have to know that you do not know somebody until
                you know them.</p>
                <p>Taoist view of seduction: Love and happiness within
                yourself. Relationship is like a stretch.</p>
                <p>IDENTITY</p>
                <p>We are always processing the world through that
                little seed in our mind which is identity</p>
                <p>Much of your identity is arbitrary. And it comes from
                social feedback while you’re interacting with other
                people. Many of the personality traits you have are
                built on reaction.</p>
                <p>Nature-Nurture debate? There are countless examples
                of people that rose above that.</p>
                <p>Think about things like depression, self-pity and
                victim mindset. Those are called luxuries. Existenial
                angst? That’s a beautiful luxury the modern-day.</p>
                <p>Who you are today can be completely different in a
                year from now.</p>
                <p>First-hand and second-hand information.</p>
                <p>RAS</p>
                <p>Put focus on what might be valuable to you. Someone
                who has more certainty than you would probably seem to
                have value.</p>
                <p>INFERENCE</p>
                <p>Your situation is always changing. And as it does,
                your mind is always looking at social feedback to figure
                out how much value you have and determine which
                personality is approciate at the time.</p>
                <p>Don’t be afraid of being an idiot. Any newbie is
                gonna look like a dumbass, that’s called reality. A very
                big part of mastery in terms of success with women is
                the ability to endure humiliation repeatly.</p>
                <p>Human being’s two major assets is intelligence and
                social bounding.</p>
                <p>STATE</p>
                <p>Your state is the emotional system which looks at the
                situation to see wheather or not you have value and
                gives you access to part of your personality that works
                the best.</p>
                <p>Resistance is the emotion you experience when you
                wish the reality in front of you was in some different
                way.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>state is very liberating</li>
                <li>when you’re not in state, don’t resist it. Just take
                the right action.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your identity criteria is where your mind looks to
                reference how much value you have. In other words, the
                rules you have to decide wheather or not you go into
                state.</p>
                <p>Role is just a role. And you don’t need to identify
                yourself with that role. Someone might judge you. You
                don’t even need to correct them.</p>
                <p><strong>How Mind Works</strong></p>
                <p>success barrier: you think you want it, but your mind
                has blocked the way to it</p>
                <p>Fear of your own success: most people more fear of
                their own greatness than failure.</p>
                <p>The further you push beyond your previous concept of
                where you should be, the more anxiety you’re gonna
                feel.</p>
                <p>As far as your mind is concerned, your perception of
                reality does not have to be objective, it just has to be
                accurate enough to keep you going.</p>
                <p>Most people are not really too concerned about
                objectivity, as long as their concept of reality keeps
                them alive, that’s all what matters. As long as your
                mind is concerned, if your view of reality has kept you
                alive for this long. Believe it or not, it’s easier to
                bury itself deeper into the existing reality than deal
                with the headaches of thiking through a potential harder
                to understand more complex view of reality.</p>
                <p>Ramifications of new reality: The doubts that you
                have the mental energy to learn all the new ins and
                outs. The nauseous feeling that you are going backwards
                in your understanding about this world. A sort of
                instinct that people might not accept the new you.</p>
                <p>We all live in somewhat of a subjective reality. No
                matter how objective you think you are, there is
                subjectivity meshed into there.</p>
                <p>We have a mechanism which makes us instinctly grip
                our reality so we can appear to be sure of ourselves and
                appear to have a strong sense of certainty.</p>
                <p>Signpost after signpost pointing you in a certain of
                being</p>
                <p><strong>CORE Confidence</strong></p>
                <p>Could true core confidence exist is a philosophical
                problem. But there’s definitely people who have a lot
                more core confidence than others.</p>
                <p>Most people need to get people reacting to them
                before they can feel confident.</p>
                <p>When you feel confident, people react to you.</p>
                <p>Core confidence come from an unshakable conviction of
                who you are and what you are entitled to. It’s a
                confidence that allows you to take on a charismatic
                attitude that gets people reacting to you regardless of
                the situation you are in.</p>

                <li>You identify yourself as an individual who cannot be
                categorized with the dynamic and flexible identity that
                could involve at any time that you choose.</li>
                <li>You know what you’ve been through in life and trust
                yourself to get by in any situation no matter what.</li>
                <li>You value your own opionion of yourself more highly
                than the opionions of others and you determine your
                value by criteria that is your own.</li>
                <li>You don’t need other people to validate that your
                best qualities exist.</li>
                <li>You believe your life, perspective and energy have
                an inherent value wheather other people acknowledge it
                or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Put in the seeds and let the core confidence blossom.
                As it comes out more and more, you’ll gather more
                reference experiences for why core confidence really
                works. Then your mind will accept that this is the
                truth.</p>
                <p><strong>Sense Of Reality</strong></p>
                <p>Your sense of reality is what allows you to make
                predications about the world.</p>
                <p>You have a model of the world inside your head about
                all the different cause-and-effect relationships. It’s
                your map of how the world works. It might be
                hypothetical or it might be firsthand. It includes your
                view of people like, how they should respond to you and
                you view of what you deserve out of life.</p>
                <p>Whoever has the strongest reality wins.</p>
                <p>Whoever has the more dominant sense of reality will
                tend to impose that sense of reality onto other people
                around them.</p>
                <p>So many guys get lost in listening to the guru that
                they don’t think for themselves what is making this
                work.</p>
                <p>To understand what’s being communicated to you, you
                have to have: 1. reference experiences 2. why is this
                working.</p>
                <p>Most people don’t tend to have a very certain
                reality. They are just looking towards others to think
                how they should think or act. They are always seeking
                out certainty. and whoever has the strongest, most
                rock-solid fix interpretation of reality will usually
                have most influence and draw them into the world.</p>
                <p>Most people in general who haven’t studied
                self-actualization are not that centered. Because it’s
                unconscious competence. And they don’t know how they’re
                doing it. They feel centered most of the time, but when
                they start to fall off their center. They don’t
                recognize their behavior and don’t know what’s going
                on.</p>
                <p>When you have unweaving certainty and the least
                reaction to conflicting views.</p>
                <p>So many people are placing limitations on me, why
                would I place more of myself?</p>
                <p>Ultimately all people have more similarities then
                differences.</p>
                <p>Anywhere you can invite the girl into your world and
                let her have a taste of it without putting an pressure
                on her is really adding a lot of attraction.</p>
                <p>Strong reality: who you are, your system of value,
                personal boundary</p>
                <p>The more your reality gets broken down, the more your
                reality becomes stronger as time goes on</p>
                <p>If there’s even a little drop of integrity inside
                you, then when you go through that fire. The more fire
                you blast onto it, the more it melts off all the shit
                and all the goober and gets that core piece of integrity
                that’s inside of you.</p>
                <p>Internal &amp; External Distinction</p>
                <p><strong>Masculine Polarity</strong></p>
                <p>Masculine Polarity is your grounding amidst the
                emotional chaos. It is the magnet that draws women
                towards you in the form of your deepest self esteem.
                It’s a total trust in your faculties and your ability to
                determine reality.</p>
                <p>Some examples:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                <li>Acting only through your own intentions.</li>
                <li>Being entirely uncontrollable and above
                manipulation.</li>
                <li>Ditating the reality around you rather than being
                affected by it.</li>
                <li>Being in the moment and walk through the world with
                ease.</li>
                <li>Having abosolutely no intimidation of the girl or
                the world whatsoever.</li>
                <li>Tapping into the energy inside you not around you as
                a source of your mood.</li>
                <li>Feeling no spikes or lulls of self-esteem from any
                girl’s response to you.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>What is acting through your own intentions? something
                that you come to over years and years. it’s like peeling
                back the layers of programming, of other poeple’s
                nonsense that they’ve put into your head to get your
                core. So every year of your life goes by, you will
                become better at acting through your own intentions if
                you have that as a marker that you’re shooting
                towards.</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Being home in your environment: this is my house, we
                are friends.</li>
                <li>Carrying yourself with total confidence even a
                playful cockiness.</li>
                <li>Being the source of grounding energy and asserting
                what you’ve said is funny.</li>
                <li>Leading the conversation to the direction you want
                to go.</li>
                <li>Positioning yourself as already being chosen.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Breathe to access your higher self</p>
                <p>procactive vs reactive social strategy</p>
                <p>When you have a procactive social strategy, you’re
                making the choice to be authentic and let the chips fall
                they may</p>
                <p>Reactive social strategy is you keep trying to modify
                yourself and adapt yourself for every type of
                situation.</p>
                <p>Man is action, women is reaction</p>
                <p><strong>Girl Behavior</strong></p>
                <p>unconscious learned behaviors to assert polarity:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>She is the prize: put guys in situations to keep her
                always happy</li>
                <li>Only being moved by an energy that’s better than the
                one she’s already experienced (Where the social energy
                is, the women go)</li>
                <li>Rewarding good behavior with little taste of
                physical attention</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This behavior will try to get you reactive</p>
                <p>The more you invest the more you backwards
                rationalize that you are doing this for good reason, and
                the more you keep investing ad nauseam</p>
                <p>Women want to experience all kinds of emotions
                fully</p>
                <p>Disrupting her reality so she wants to reassert the
                reality by getting you to respond the way she wants.</p>
                <p><strong>Anticipated Response</strong></p>
                <p>Also called assumption, your map of how you expect
                the world to respond you.</p>
                <p>People are always doing things to to cause their
                anticipated response to come true. Trying to maintain
                their reality. Trying to make the world make sense.</p>
                <p>approval seek</p>
                <p>Self fullfilling prophecy</p>
                <p>This happens because your minds is always seeking out
                evidence, even it’s obscure to reinforce your existing
                beliefs. and because the confidence that you have in
                those beliefs, you draw people into the reality and
                inadvertently get them to act in ways that you don’t
                expect.</p>
                <p>no shift in state so you don’t need to win the verbal
                match</p>
                <p>flinching or retreating into your mind</p>
                <p>value-giving mindset</p>
                <p>To have unweaving beliefs, you must:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>fully assume what you’re gonna do is gonna work</li>
                <li>indifferent with the outcome that doesn’t</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The half way point between fear and total belief is
                indifference</p>
                <p>By going out every night, getting hammered, getting
                humiliated, getting embarrassed. You can get a lot of
                evidence of one thing: it really doesn’t matter what
                other poeple think of you.</p>
                <p>Eventually you cross something that’s beautiful, and
                that’s something called indifference threshold.
                harmonious ting of true indifference.</p>
                <p>truly letting go of the outcome, not seeking in their
                interactions anymore, loss of neediness.</p>
                <p>The system if put there so that you cannot be
                confident and successful unless you really have what
                women want, that survival reproduction value.</p>
                <p>You have to scramble the system and your fucking
                brain. What you have to do is pummel your brain with so
                many references that the whole system just goes</p>
                <p>stifling check</p>
                <p>whenever I’m out on my own, I don’t say to myself I
                need to be confident right now. I just say I need to
                cross the indifference threshold as quickly as
                possible.</p>
                <p>Don’t try to be confident at first, try to be
                indifferent. Condifence will then flow from that
                point.</p>
                <p>Once your mind clicks, your ras starts to look at the
                behaviors of cool guys with more clarity than it did
                before.</p>
                <p>how to unstyfle yourself ? we are all confined by our
                egos, and we all hate. If some can get unstyfled, you
                can lead the crowd to be unstyfled.</p>

                <p>VALUE is like MAGNET.</p>
                <p>We are designed to be drawn to towards value.</p>
                <p>Back to the caveman days, the women are looking for
                decisiveness, resourcefulness, dominantness, fearless, a
                guy who dictates reality it does not have reality
                dictated to him.</p>
                <p>Attraction is straightforward.</p>
                <p>Am I trying to live up to her standards? NO ! She is
                trying live up to my standards. cos that’s coming
                accross in the sub communication. Then she will be far
                more attracted to you.</p>
                <p>When you have value, you’ll naturally feel
                comfortable in the skin. You are in the momnet.
                Otherwise you’re in your head.</p>
                <p>Express your personality freely and let the chicks

                <p>But the question is why are we shaping it, how are we

                or are we doing this for the sake of right action.</p>
