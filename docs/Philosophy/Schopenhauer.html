                <p>A sort of negative evaluation of the human world
                creating desire as a problem to be solved.</p>
                <p>Powerful strain of indian eastern pessimism which is
                a combination of hinduism and buddhism.</p>
                <p>“The world as will and idea”, a great book that takes
                the tradition of German idealism and inverts some of the
                main ideas.</p>
                <p>Thomas Mann refer to this book as a symphony in form
                movements. It’s sort of a verbal music, has a high
                poetic content.</p>
                <p>Kant think there are people and there are objects.
                But we can never experience these objects in an
                unmediated way. Acutally we actively construct those
                objects by imposing on categories we can’t avoid. Such
                as space, time, causality, numbers, etc. And this is
                built into experiencing the world as a subject.</p>
                <p>And we can never know the ding on zig (thing in
                itself). I can’t experiecne the podium as it really is.
                I guess in the mind of god it’s independent of space,
                time and causality and number. But I have to look
                through the window (the apriori forms). I have no choice
                and the only access to it.</p>
                <p>In the first chapter. Schopenhauer think the world is
                what Kant says it is, it’s one a big idea. So we have
                all these overlapping forms and our whole experiencing
                of the world is one big idea.</p>
                <p>In the second chapter, Schopenhauer tries to invert
                kant and says there is one example. The one thing in
                itself that I can know is the will, my own self
                consciousness. That is not mediated by the apriori
                forms, I have direct immediate apprehension of that
                fact. The external world is mediated by the apriori
                forms. The internal world is not the way kant think it
                is. It’s one unitary thing will. Here the view is like
                Hobbes said we are desiring animals. Schopenhauer will
                say yes, we are desiring animals. But we do not know
                ourselves, we do not really know our own wills.
                Consciouness is only a subset of will. Reason is only a
                subset of will. Will is a force that reason neither
                controls nor understands. We are subject to a terrifying
                force bigger than we are mysterious to us that we are
                unable to control. So we lose that enlightment optimism,
                the idea that we are in control, we are reasonable
                animals in control of our wills. In fact, the will is
                controlling us and the will is a mysterious force that
                we find in not just in individual but in all of nature
                and in all of human beings as a whole. So it’s one big
                unitray thing.</p>
                <p>Will is a blind and ateleological force which
                animates all of nature. It’s an extremely sort of
                pessimistic view of the human psyche. We are play things
                in the hand of not even gods but something less than god
                because it doesn’t have a will and doesn’t like us. It
                just is what it is. In some ways it’s anti-socratic. It
                means essentially that you can’t know yourself or that
                if you can know yourself, it’s only after the facts.</p>
                <p>Then what we get? we get world as outside and world
                as inside. The world as outside is the world as idea.
                The world as inside is the world as will. This faces us
                with a problem. What the hell are we and how are we to
                deal with all these difficulties that the world
                confronts us with. Because we are desiring animals? And
                desire is a purely negative condition. Here comes the
                buddhism, the hinduism and that kind of pessimistic
                eastern philosophy.</p>
                <p>This introduction of the idea of will into German
                philosophy is going to be pregant with very important
                consequences for the late ninteenth and early twentieth
                century if you think of people like Nietzsche.</p>
                <p>The last two movements of this great philosophical
                symphony, this kind of exercise and negativity are an
                attempt to solve the problem of the world as idea in
                movement three and then movement four it’s an attempt to
                solve the problem of the world as will.</p>
                <p>What mysticism and asceticism have in common is the
                fact that they both long for the abolition of self
                worship of your own extinction. It’s embracing your own
                finitude because the particular time and space and
                experience contained within your finitude are
                relentlessly awful. This longing for extinction is sort
                of a philosophical suicide or a sort of ode to
                death.</p>
                <p>The conclusion that Schopenhauer draws here about
                human condition are two. First of all is inverted and
                bizarre and negative. He says Leibniz is wrong. This is
                actually the worst possible of all worlds. If it was any
                worse it wouldn’t exist at all. It’s just good enough so
                that it has some existence, but if the world got any
                worse, it just wouldn’t exist and the fact it exist
                shows how bad it is.</p>
                <p>The second proposition is that it’s better not to be
                born. We are a bundle of desires. We are a collection of
                questions. Our desires never get satisfied and our
                questions never get answered. And you get stuck with
                them. Schopenhauer says I just want to throw in the
                towel and release me. But there is no god to pray to, so
                he does this.</p>
                <p>So mysticism and asceticism is the solution to the
                problem of the self. The solution of the problem of
                subjectivity is ethics and aesthetics.</p>
